# Decoding Den Project Roadmap

## The Big Picture (3 Pillars)

| Pillar | Purpose | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|
| 1. 8 Stages | Scope & sequence + teaching resources | Content exists, needs organization |
| 2. Decoding Den | Quick phoneme lookup for teachers | Works, needs UI polish |
| 3. Student Tools | Practice activities pushed from teacher | Future phase |

---

## Simplified Workflow

Instead of doing everything at once, work in small, focused sprints:

```
PHASE 1: Perfect Decoding Den UI (1-2 sessions)
    ↓
PHASE 2: Verify Data Completeness (1 session)
    ↓
PHASE 3: Organize 8 Stages Resources (2-3 sessions)
    ↓
PHASE 4: Connect Student Tools (future)
```

## Phase 1: Decoding Den UI Redesign

**Why start here?**
- It's the tool YOU use most
- Quick wins = motivation
- Once it's clean, we can see what data is missing

**What we'll do:**
1. Identify pain points in current layout
2. Sketch a simpler design together
3. Implement changes

**Questions to answer:**
- What slows you down or feels clunky?
- Too many clicks to get to what you need?
- Information is scattered?
- Layout is confusing?

## Phase 2: Verify Data Completeness

**Goal:** Ensure all phoneme data is complete and accurate

**Check:**
- [ ] All 44 phonemes have complete data
- [ ] Grapheme frequencies are accurate
- [ ] Word lists exist for each phoneme
- [ ] Articulation guidance is complete

---

## Phase 3: Organize 8 Stages Resources

**Goal:** Compile teaching resources in simple, accessible format

**For each stage:**
- [ ] Weekly lesson plans
- [ ] Downloadable/printable resources
- [ ] Assessment materials
- [ ] Teaching scripts

---

## Phase 4: Student Tools (Future)

**Goal:** Connect teacher "push" to student practice activities

- Elkonin boxes
- Phoneme keyboard
- Whiteboard practice
- Story reading
