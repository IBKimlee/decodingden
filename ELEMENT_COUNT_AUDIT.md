# Element Count Audit

## Current Database Counts
- Stage 1: 15 elements
- Stage 2: 12 elements  
- Stage 3: 8 elements
- Stage 4: 6 elements
- Stage 5: 8 elements
- Stage 6: 8 elements
- Stage 7: 8 elements (recently changed from 11)
- Stage 8: 10 elements (recently changed from 15)

**Current Total: 75 elements**

## User Reports: Only 71 elements
**Missing: 4 elements**

## Possible Issues

### 1. Documentation Mismatch
PRIMARY_SOURCES.md shows:
- Stage 2: 7 elements (database shows 12)
- Stage 7: 11 elements (database shows 8)

### 2. Counting Method Differences
- Are we counting phonemes, graphemes, or phoneme-grapheme correspondences?
- Are we counting morphemes (prefixes/suffixes) as single elements?
- Are we counting silent letter patterns as separate elements?

### 3. Potential Solutions Needed
1. Audit actual weekly data implementation
2. Count elements consistently across all stages
3. Update database to match actual implementation
4. Verify research-based totals are maintained

## Action Required
1. Count actual elements in each stage's weekly data
2. Identify which counting method is authoritative
3. Update all sources to be consistent
4. Restore total to research-validated count
